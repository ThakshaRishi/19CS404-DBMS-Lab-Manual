# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

| **Member — Books — Session**         | M : M                                  | Optional for both                           | Members can book multiple sessions; sessions can be booked by many members.     |
| **Member — Make — Payment**          | 1 : M                                  | Member (mandatory), Payment (mandatory)     | Each payment belongs to one member; members can make multiple payments.         |

### Assumptions

A session is always conducted by one trainer.

Members can join zero or many programs.

A program must have a trainer assigned (based on diagram’s participation).

A member may book sessions independently of joining programs.

Attendance is only recorded for booked sessions.

Payment does not depend on programs or sessions; a member simply makes payments.

Booking relationship between Member and Session is M:N but represented implicitly through Attendance (or could be a separate link table).

# Scenario B: City Library Event & Book Lending System

**Business Context:**  
The Central Library wants to manage book lending and cultural events.

**Requirements:**  
- Members borrow books, with loan and return dates tracked.  
- Each book has title, author, and category.  
- Library organizes events; members can register.  
- Each event has one or more speakers/authors.  
- Rooms are booked for events and study.  
- Overdue fines apply for late returns.

### Assumptions

Each loan is strictly linked to one book (not multiple books per loan).

A member can exist without creating loans or attending events.

Fines only exist if a loan has exceeded its expiry date.

Every event must be held in a room.

Author/Speaker is treated as its own entity, not part of Member.

Each event has one speaker, and each speaker conducts one event at a time.

Room availability indicates whether the room can host events.

## Instructions for Students

1. Complete **all three scenarios** (A, B, C).  
2. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes for each.  
3. Draw ER diagrams using **draw.io / diagrams.net** or hand-drawn & scanned.  
4. Fill in all tables and assumptions for each scenario.  
5. Export the completed Markdown (with diagrams) as **a single PDF**
